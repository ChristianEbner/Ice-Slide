# Concept

This minigame is about the player being able to move left and right on the x-axis. On the screen there are several ice platforms, each with its own hole.
As the screen moves up, the player must use the arrow keys to get to the holes in the ice platforms as fast as he can to continue down.
If you do not make it, and you touch the top of the screen, you've lost and it's Game Over.
The motivation is, that you want to stay in the game as long as possible.

The goal is to overcome as many ice platforms as possible.

The Player you control is a penguin slipping over the ice platforms.

The theme "ice age" will be recognized because the background consists an ice landscape.
The launch and game over screen is also designed in an "ice design".

If you click the start button in the "home screen", the game starts and you get to the "Main screen". Once you touch the top of the screen you will you be redirected to the "Game Over-Screen". Here you will find the button "Start Again". If you click on this button, the game starts all over again. So you return to the "Main screen".

# Lessons learned

Everytime I work on another Minigame or exercise, I understand the code and the structure of the code a little bit more.
In this project especially I learned an understood the Random function.


# Limitations

No Power Ups
Pretty simple Game
